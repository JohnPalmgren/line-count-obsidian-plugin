# Line Count Plugin for Obsidian

## Description
This is a demo project to get me started developing for the Obsidian ecosystem. My motivation is to be able to contribute to open source Obsidian plugins and develop plugins if necessary. 

This was created following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgXa03ZxJ88&t=792s) from Florian Ludwig. It is created from the [sample plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) code provided by Obsidian.

The plugin provides a line count to the status bar along with the word and character count.
